//! A Discord forum, which shows its posts in place of messages, as Discord's
//! client shows one: its active posts, pinned ones first, then its older,
//! archived ones a page at a time, or the posts a search of their titles
//! finds. Each post shows as a card with its first message. The active posts
//! are the server's, as its snapshot shares them; their first messages are
//! asked for ten at a time, for the cards near the top and then for more as
//! the list scrolls, as Discord's client asks for those it shows. Archived
//! pages and a search's results bring their own. All of it is kept only
//! while the forum shows.
